PDF Upload Directory

This directory is used for storing PDF files that will be processed and added to the knowledge base.

To process PDF files in this directory:
1. Place your PDF files here
2. Run the script: node scripts/process-pdf-docs.js
3. The processed files will be available in the knowledge base

For testing PDF extraction, you can use:

Note: You'll need to provide your own PDF files for testing as they are not included in the repository.
