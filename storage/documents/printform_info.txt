## Design Guidelines

### General Design Guidelines

1. **Wall Thickness**
   - Maintain uniform wall thickness whenever possible
   - Avoid abrupt transitions between thick and thin sections
   - Recommended minimum wall thickness varies by process and material

2. **Draft Angles**
   - Include appropriate draft angles for molded parts
   - Typically 1-3° for injection molding
   - 3-5° for cast urethane parts

3. **Radii and Fillets**
   - Add radii to internal corners to reduce stress concentration
   - Use fillets to strengthen joints and improve material flow

4. **Tolerances**
   - Specify tolerances only where functionally necessary
   - Consider the capabilities of each manufacturing process
   - Tighter tolerances generally increase cost

### Material Selection

When selecting materials, consider:
- Mechanical properties (strength, flexibility, hardness)
- Environmental factors (temperature, UV exposure, chemical resistance)
- Regulatory requirements (FDA, UL, RoHS)
- Cost and availability
- Appearance and finish requirements

Our engineering team can assist with material selection based on your specific requirements.
